# MERN Boilerplate with Docker and React Hooks
Need some quick Boilerplate for a MERN app? You've come to the right place!
## How do I use this?
Clone the repo, navigate to the repo in your terminal, and run: sudo docker-compose up. Everything should just run automatically.
## What should I do with this?
Anything you want! Use it to build a more robust app (preferably one that does more than tell you your API and Database are working properly).
